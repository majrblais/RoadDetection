This directory is used as a guide to train our models on Compute Canada.

- `model_tf.py`: The code that trains our model with the data created using matching images/masks.
- `run_vgg19_0.0001_Unet.sh`: An example script used to launch the training code with arguments such as the architecture, learning rate, and model used.
- `create_scripts.ipynb`: The code used to generate various permutations of the scripts used to launch the training code.
